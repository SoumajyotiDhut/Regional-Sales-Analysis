# Regional Sales Analysis

A data-driven project that uncovers key insights from five years of sales data across U.S. regions. This project leverages exploratory data analysis (EDA) and an interactive Power BI dashboard to support strategic decision-making for marketing, sales, and operations teams.

##  Problem Statement

Analyze Acme Co.’s 2014–2018 sales data to identify key revenue and profit drivers across products, channels, and regions; uncover seasonal trends and outliers; and align performance against budgets. Use these insights to optimize pricing, promotions, and market expansion for sustainable growth and reduced concentration risk.

> **Objective**: Deliver actionable insights from Acme Co.’s 2014–2018 sales data to:

 - Identify top-performing products, channels, and regions driving revenue and profit
 - Uncover seasonal trends and anomalies for optimized planning
 - Spot pricing and margin risks from outlier transactions
 - Inform pricing, promotion, and market-expansion strategies
These findings will guide the design of a Power BI dashboard to support strategic decision-making and sustainable growth.

## Business Question

How can we empower sales teams with clear, data-backed insights into regional performance to identify high-growth opportunities and optimize resource allocation?

---

## Approach

### Phase 1 – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Cleaned and merged multiple unlinked tables: Sales, Products, Customers, Regions, States, and Budgets
- Engineered features such as `profit` and `profit_margin_pct`
- Visualized monthly trends, product performance, customer segmentation, and sales distribution

### Phase 2 – Power BI Dashboard
- Built a live, interactive dashboard for business users
- Enabled slicing by time, product, region, and channel
- Highlighted trends, outliers, and actionable insights

##  Key Insights

- **Monthly Revenue Cycle**:Revenue stays stable between ≈ 23M -26.5M across 2014–2017, with no consistent seasonal spikes. Sharpest drop (≈$21.2M) occurs in early 2017, indicating a possible one-time disruption. 
- **Channel Mix**: Wholesale: 54%. Distributors: 31%. Exports: 15% — opportunity to scale international presence.  
- **Top Products (Revenue)**: Product 26:118M ; Product 25:110M; Product 13:78M. Mid -tier:68–75M; bottom performers: $52–57M.
- **Profit Margins:**:Profit margins range broadly from ≈18% to ≈60%, with no strong correlation to unit price. Dense horizontal bands suggest standardized pricing strategies across tiers.
- **Seasonal Volume:**: No strong monthly pattern, but slight volume uptick appears around May–June. Early 2017 dip (≈$21.2M) may require investigation.
